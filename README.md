coalseam and pedsim
=========================

`coalseam` generates simulated genetic loci by simulating coalescence through
randomly generated population pedigrees. Data are output in a format similar to
Hudson's `ms` program. `pedsim` simulates pedigrees and outputs various
properties of coalescence in the pedigrees, including distributions of pairwise
coalescence times and summaries thereof.

Use `make` to compile the program. (See the `Makefile` for options.)

See `coalped --help` and `pedsim --help` for usage and features.
